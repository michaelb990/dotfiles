Dotfiles
=======
a collection of dotfiles that I have found useful. most of them are stolen.

## How this works
* `rake install` from the base dir of the repo will trigger an install
* the script will link the files to .files in the home directory

## Sources of inspiration
* cdzombak/dotfiles
* holman/dotfiles
* ryanb/dotfiles
* ... will add more as I find them.

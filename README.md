Dotfiles
=======
a collection of dotfiles that I have found useful.

### How this works
* `rake install` from the base dir of the repo will trigger an install
* the script will link the files to .files in the home directory

### Good examples to keep an eye on
* cdzombak/dotfiles
* holman/dotfiles
* ryanb/dotfiles
* ... will add more as I find them.
